My name is Sierra Grey-Coker, and I am a first-year Biostatistics PhD student at the [Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health](https://publichealth.jhu.edu). My research interests include causal inference, health equity, and policy, and how place affects health.

This May I graduated as a Sondheim Public Affairs scholar from the [University of Maryland, Baltimore County (UMBC)](https://www.umbc.edu), where I studied mathematics and public health. As an undergraduate, I also participated in the Summer Institute for Research Education in Biostatistics at Boston University, funded by the National Heart, Lungs, and Blood Institute, where I analyzed data collected from the Framingham Heart Study and Jackson Heart Study, and worked with a team to identify genetic variants associated with blood pressure in Hispanics.

I first became interested in public health because of John Snow and his work on the 1854 Cholera outbreak in London.
